<h2>Getting to Know Me</h2>
<p>My name is Nora E. Carambot. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico. Being a life learning student, I have completed many degrees.</p>
<p>Even though I have not travel around the world, I have visited many states. Over the road or on the air, travel is one of the most amazing activities to enjoy. Before COVID, I traveled, at least, two times a year. Since then, the only trip I have done was a road trip to Florida.</p>
<p>Among the many things that interest me are:</p>
<ul><li>Computers, fascinatingâ€¦</li>
<li>Music touches my heart. I love singing and playing the piano and the guitar.</li>
<li>Travel is astonishing and exiting.</li></ul>
<p>Through this website I want to share with you some of the most amazing places to visit in Puerto Rico.</p>
